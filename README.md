# Blender-Parallax-Auto-Rendering

This project was made as my R&D project for university.
It's a bit simple but hopefully for anyone who wants to speed up rendering out parallax maps this code could be useful.

You should also notice the code is made for cube mapping for unreal engine with the capability of rendering simple cube map textures, this is because the project final step was creating a parallax shader combining both principles.
